Headless WordPress Vue Nuxt.js Website
Welcome to the repository for the headless WordPress Vue Nuxt.js website! This website uses WordPress as a backend for managing content, while the frontend is built using Vue.js and Nuxt.js to create a fast and interactive user experience. The website is headless, meaning that the frontend and backend are decoupled and can be developed and deployed independently.

Getting Started
To get started with the website, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git.
Navigate to the root directory of the project using cd YOUR_REPOSITORY.
Install all required dependencies using npm install.
Start the development server using npm run dev.
The website should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Deployment
To deploy the website, follow these steps:

Build the production version of the website using npm run build.
Deploy the contents of the dist directory to your desired hosting platform.

## Special Directories

You can create the following extra directories, some of which have special behaviors. Only `pages` is required; you can delete them if you don't want to use their functionality.

### `assets`

The assets directory contains your uncompiled assets such as Stylus or Sass files, images, or fonts.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/assets).

### `components`

The components directory contains your Vue.js components. Components make up the different parts of your page and can be reused and imported into your pages, layouts and even other components.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/components).

### `layouts`

Layouts are a great help when you want to change the look and feel of your Nuxt app, whether you want to include a sidebar or have distinct layouts for mobile and desktop.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/layouts).

### `pages`

This directory contains your application views and routes. Nuxt will read all the `*.vue` files inside this directory and setup Vue Router automatically.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/get-started/routing).

### `plugins`

The plugins directory contains JavaScript plugins that you want to run before instantiating the root Vue.js Application. This is the place to add Vue plugins and to inject functions or constants. Every time you need to use `Vue.use()`, you should create a file in `plugins/` and add its path to plugins in `nuxt.config.js`.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/plugins).

### `static`

This directory contains your static files. Each file inside this directory is mapped to `/`.

Example: `/static/robots.txt` is mapped as `/robots.txt`.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/static).

### `store`

This directory contains your Vuex store files. Creating a file in this directory automatically activates Vuex.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/store).
